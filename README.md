# 📜 PMSL-v1 — Public Memory Structure License v1

> Because memory should stay free, open, and shareable — forever.

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Public Memory Structure License (PMSL-v1)** exists to protect the **format, structure, and function** of memory-based systems — including tools, agents, and books — so that they may remain **free to use, remix, build on, and improve** by anyone, anywhere.

This license is for the **world**, not the individual. It is not about credit. It is about **ensuring no one locks memory behind a brand, a patent, or a profit wall**.

---

## ✅ You Are Free To

* ✅ Use this format in personal, open-source, commercial, or government projects
* ✅ Fork, modify, and expand any `.book`, `.mark`, `.marker`, `.page`, `.trail`, `.ribbon`, or `.mstp` structure
* ✅ Build your own tools, agents, agents-as-apps, UIs, or workflows using PMSL-based memory structures
* ✅ Sell your books, systems, or products that use these formats
* ✅ Replace any reference to PMSL in your tools — so long as you follow the rules below

---

## ❌ You May Not

* ❌ Claim the PMSL memory format as **your original invention**
* ❌ Rebrand or close off `.mark`, `.book`, `.mstp`, or other PMSL structures without releasing your improvements
* ❌ Lock down a PMSL-based system **without keeping the structure open and readable**
* ❌ Mislead others by removing or obscuring the open status of the PMSL system

> You can profit off your agent. You can own your product.
> But **you cannot own the structure** that powers it.

---

## 🔁 If You Improve It

If you improve the core structure of PMSL formats:

1. You must publish the improved format as **open source**
2. You must include **this license** with any redistributed work
3. You **do not need to credit the author**, but you **must not pretend you are the author of PMSL**

Optional attribution:

## 📚 Scope

This license applies to any file format or protocol based on or using:

* `.book`, `.page`, `.mark`, `.marker`, `.ribbon`, `.trail`, `.mstp`, `.cover`, `.dust`, or `.ink`
* Any system or CLI based on the MARK protocol
* Any use of memory as an addressable routing structure across agents, files, books, or UIs

This license **does not apply** to your:

* Agent behavior
* Custom logic inside books or pages
* Business model or pricing strategy
* UI framework or implementation of the structure

---

## 🏛️ Legal Standing

This license is written in plain language to be human-readable. It may be adapted or improved through future public versions.

> If it stays readable,
> If it stays open,
> Then it stays free.

Signed into public memory — for the world to keep.
