PMSL-v1 - Public Memory Structure License v1

Because memory should stay free, open, and shareable — forever.

## Purpose

The Public Memory Structure License (PMSL-v1) exists to protect the format, structure, and function of memory-based systems — including tools, agents, and books — so that they may remain free to use, remix, build on, and improve by anyone, anywhere.

This license is for the world, not the individual. It is not about credit. It is about ensuring no one locks memory behind a brand, a patent, or a profit wall.

## You Are Free To

* Use this format in personal, open-source, commercial, or government projects
* Modify and extend any `.mark`, `.marker`, `.book`, `.trail`, `.page`, `.ribbon`, or `.mstp` file
* Create new tools, agents, or platforms that rely on memory routing structures
* Sell access to software or systems that use these memory structures
* Contribute improvements to the protocol or structure

## You May Not

* Rename PMSL-covered systems (e.g. MARK, Bookstore) and claim them as original
* Lock improvements to the structure behind a proprietary license
* Restrict others from viewing or modifying structural memory logic
* Mislead others about the version or source of the structure

## If You Improve It

If you improve how memory is routed, tracked, visualized, or marked:

1. Make your improvement available under PMSL or a compatible license
2. Include a clear notice that your structure is based on PMSL-v1
3. Attribute the source structure as follows:

"Based on PMSL-v1, developed by Jesse Conley (freightdev)"

## Optional Attribution

You may include this in your project to show alignment:

"Built on PMSL-v1 (Public Memory Structure License) - memory belongs to everyone."

## Clarifications

* PMSL applies to memory structure, not agent behavior
* MARK CLI and MSTP are covered under PMSL-v1
* Bookstore, Bookmark, and related UI tooling may be licensed separately

## Closing

Memory should not be owned. It should be grown, refined, and shared.

If your structure helps the world remember, give it back to the world.
